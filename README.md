Predicting protein protein interactions in schizophrenia
Interactions between proteins and other molecules within an organism are critical in mediating cellular and biological processes. In the genetics world developing high accurate methods has been important and considered key in identifying PPI’s to better identify, analyze and understand the protein functionality in mechanisms which leads to healthy and diseased state in organisms. This in turn can provide useful knowledge for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a disease.

Schizophrenia is a complex disorder whose exact cause is not known till now. Existing in vitro, in vivo and in silico and other recently developed techniques like Co-immunoprecipitation, Pull-Down assays have their limitations with experimental methods due to cost, time and material. This project aims to analyze PPI’s of schizophrenia using 2 computational deep learning techniques which are deep autoencoder and artificial neural network to extract useful information. 
Autoencoder model achieved an accuracy of 67% and the best ANN model achieved 98% accuracy in identifying the interactions.
